# Performance-Monitoring-Enhancer
Performance Monitoring Enhancer is a lightweight Forge mod that overlays real-time performance stats—current FPS, 1 % low FPS, 0.01 % low FPS, server TPS and ping—directly on your screen. Use H to show/hide the HUD, G to enter a paused drag-mode for repositioning, and K to open a settings GUI where you can choose exactly which metrics to display.
